Write out on paper, how you would do the following:


1) Plot the data from the file HIVseries.csv from class (same file from Chapter 4.1.1). Plot this file's data, clearly labeling x and y axis (including units), include Title, and add legend. Make this plot look complete.    

          i) Write up your code with paper and pen (do this before you type anything on your computer!)

          ii) Print out the plot.

2)  Sines and Cosines:

      a) Plot Sin(x) by itself for some range of x that shows at least 1 full cycle (eg x = -2*np.pi to +2*np.pi)

           i) Write up your code with paper and pen first.

           ii) Show your Plot print out. (no labels of any kind needed)


      b) Plot Cos(x) by itself for some range of x that shows at least 1 full cycle (eg x = -2pi to +2pi)

           i) Write up your code with paper and pen first.

           ii) Show your Plot print out. (no labels of any kind needed)


      c) Plot Sin(x) and Cos(x) simultaneously together on the same axes. Clearly labeling which is which, including title, axis labels, legends!

            i) Hand write your code

            ii) Print out your plot. (with Title, x and y axis labels, legend)


3) Load data directly in your Python script from the url below. (what does url stand for again?)

        https://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/ftp/trends/temp/vostok/vostok.1999.temp.dat


      a)  Load the data into a numpy array. 

           i) Display how many rows there are. 

           ii) Display how many columns there are.


      c) Make a plot with 2nd column( age of ice BP)  as x-axis  and 4th column (Temp variation deg C) as the y-axis.

         Include : Title, x-axis label(with units), y-axis label (with units).  

        What do you think you have plotted?


      d) Show a print out of your plot, including Title, x and y axis-labels and  legends.
