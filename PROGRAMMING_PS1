From Chapter 3 - Loops

Your turn: 3A (homework)

A) Write out what you need (in IPython console) to type to evaluate function y = e-(x^2)  over a range of values of 'x'.

        i) Use for loop first.

        ii) Then use vectorize notations.

B) We often wish to evaluate the function   (exp[-mu])*(mu^n) /(n!) over the integer values of n=0,1,...,N.

n! means n factorial. Write out the code you need in IPython console to get this in vectorized notation for N=10 and mu=2. 

Do this without importing any factorial functions first.

             *NOTE for part b* 

             1) YOU MIGHT STILL NEED A 'FOR' LOOP BECAUSE NP.ARANGE(START,STOP,STRIDE) DOES NOT LIKE ANY ARRAYS AS    ARGUMENTS.

             2) IF YOU ARE HAVING PROBLEMS DIVIDING BY 0, (IN THE 0!) , YOU CAN JUST USE n=1,....,N.


C) Now repeat Part B) using imported factorial function from scipy.special.

(you can " import scipy.special as sp" then use sp.factorial or  " from scipy.special import factorial " then use factorial )
